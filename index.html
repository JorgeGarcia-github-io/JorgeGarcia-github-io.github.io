        <div id="box3"><p>Porsche 930 Turbo: This car is based on the 911, but it features the first turbocharger ever applied to a 911. It has a wider body in order to fit the wider rear tires and a huge spoiler. Although it was pretty fast, it had a tendency to brutally oversteer mid-corner.

        <h2><div id="box4">Best cars from the 80´s</h2></div>
        <div id="box1"><p>The 80’s were a controversial decade that made a significant change in technology, designs and classification of cars. Due to tight emissions and environmental laws, the power figures weren´t high. In spite of this, manufacturers found out how to produce powerful cars using turbo technology.
        The 80’s car imports were dominated by Japanese made cars; that were famous for their reliability and low price.</p></div>
        <h3>Top Cars</h3>
        <div id="box4"><p>Ferrari F40: Many people believe that the F40 is the best Ferrari of all time. That’s because it was very ahead of its time.

The F40 was the first production car that could reach 320 km/h, and its big spoiler and pop-up headlights are an icon of the 80´s.
