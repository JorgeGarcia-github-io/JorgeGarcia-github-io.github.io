        <h3>Top Cars</h3>
        <div id="box3"><p>Dodge Challenger: The first Challenger model made its debut in 1970, and new models are still being produced each year.  This particular model is a particulary iconic muscle car; and its big hood and straight angles are still present in modern Challengers

        <div id="box3"><p>Porsche 930 Turbo: This car is based on the 911, but it features the first turbocharger ever applied to a 911. It has a wider body in order to fit the wider rear tires and a huge spoiler. Although it was pretty fast, it had a tendency to brutally oversteer mid-corner.

        <h2><div id="box4">Best cars from the 80´s<h2></div>
        <div id="box1"><p>The 80’s were a controversial decade that made a significant change in technology, designs and classification of cars. Due to tight emissions and environmental laws, the power figures weren´t high. In spite of this, manufacturers found out how to produce powerful cars using turbo technology.
        The 80’s car imports were dominated by Japanese made cars; that were famous for their reliability and low price.</p></div>
        <h3>Top Cars</h3>
        <div id="box4"><p>Ferrari F40: Many people believe that the F40 is the best Ferrari of all time. That’s because it was very ahead of its time.  It has a ultra-light carbon fiber body along with a powerful V8 that is paired with two twin turbos. The F40 was the first production car that could reach 320 km/h, and its big spoiler and pop-up headlights are an icon of the 80´s.
