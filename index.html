        <div id="box1"><p>During the 60’s; American car companies dominated the field.
        General Motors, Ford and Chrysler had a huge market in America; and they also sold many cars overseas. 
        Races were becoming mainstream, and customers started to look for increased speed and performance.
        Safety features such as seatbelts and power steering made their way into manufacturing too.</p></div>
        <h3>Top Cars</h3>
        <div id="box2"><p>Ford GT40: The GtT40 is a 24h of LeMans legend. It was born in order to compete with Ferrari,
        that had won in LeMans for the last six years. The car was developed by the newborn Ford Racing team along with Carroll Shelby ;
        the motorsport legend. It has been remade twice in the 21st century.

        width="230"></p>  
        <div id="box2"><p>Ferrari 250 GTO:  The 250 GTO is probably the best Ferrari roadcar from the 60’s. Only 36 were made between 1962 and 1964. It can reach up to 280 km/h . In 2018, one of these was sold for 80 million dollars. This price makes it the most expensive car ever sold on an auction.
        </p></div>    
        <p><img src="https://i.blogs.es/35ac65/ferrari-250-gto/1366_2000.jpg" width="230"></p>
        <div id="box2"><p>Shelby Cobra: In order to develop the Cobra, Caroll Shelby focused on lowering the weight and increasing the power. Although it is quite small, it fits a V8 under its hood that produces 410 HP.
        It can go from 0-100km/h in 4.2 seconds, and its unique silhouette is an emblem of car culture.</p></div>

        <h2 id="web-70"><div id="box3">Best cars from the 70´s</h2></div>
        <div id="box1"><p>In the 70’s; the American car industry took a mayor hit. Sales suffered and foreign cars took over the American market. In Europe, compact cars became hugely popular. Fuel economy started to matter due to the gas crisis.
        Japan imported many cars to Europe and America, making companies such as Toyota and Honda grow tons.</p></div>
        <h3>Top Cars</h3>
        <div id="box3"><p>Dodge Challenger: The first Challenger model made its debut in 1970, and new models are still being produced each year.  This particular model is a particulary iconic muscle car; and its big hood and straight angles are still present in modern Challengers 
        </p></div> 
        <p><img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/1970-dodge-challenger-1536067399.png?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=980:*" width="230"></p>
        <div id="box3"><p>Porsche 930 Turbo: This car is based on the 911, but it features the first turbocharger ever applied to a 911. It has a wider body in order to fit the wider rear tires and a huge spoiler. Although it was pretty fast, it had a tendency to brutally oversteer mid-corner.
        This problem is common in rear-wheel drive cars, although it isn’t as intense.</p></div>
        <p><img src="https://cdn.bringatrailer.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/9582-940x627.jpg" width= "230"></p>
        <div id="box3"><p>Lancia Stratos: The Stratos is a very important rally icon. Despite being designed for rally races; the FIA forced each company to build 500 road legal units from each car in order to compete.
        Although its engine isn’t very powerful; it can reach 200km/h in almost every surface. </p></div>
        <p><img src="https://www.lanciastratos.com/images/4.Scuderie/Lancia_Stratos-scuderie-3.jpg" width="230"></p>
        <div id="box3"><p> BMW M1: The M1 is the only official supercar that BMW has made. It has some unique features such as its mid-engine and its fibre glass body.
        BMW M,BMW´s performance branch developed the whole thing, and the machine was built between German and Italian constructors; which wasn´t common back then.</p></div>
        <p><img src="https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/098G3/s3/bmw-m1.jpg" width="230"></p>
        <h2 id="web-80"><div id="box4">Best cars from the 80´s</h2></div>
        <div id="box1"><p>The 80’s were a controversial decade that made a significant change in technology, designs and classification of cars. Due to tight emissions and environmental laws, the power figures weren´t high. In spite of this, manufacturers found out how to produce powerful cars using turbo technology.
        The 80’s car imports were dominated by Japanese made cars; that were famous for their reliability and low price.</p></div>
        <h3>Top Cars</h3>
        <div id="box4"><p>Ferrari F40: Many people believe that the F40 is the best Ferrari of all time.That’s because it was very ahead of its time. It has a ultra-light carbon fiber body along with a powerful V8 that is paired with two twin turbos.The F40 was the first production car that could reach 320 km/h, and its big spoiler and pop-up headlights are an icon of the 80´s.
        </p></div>
        <p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/FerrariF40.jpg/800px-FerrariF40.jpg" width="230"></p>
        <div id="box4"><p> 1989 Lamborghini Countach: Although the Countach was released at the beginning  of the 70´s, the first Countach models didn´t look similar to the ones from the 80´s. The latter ones had more power, a bigger spoiler and even more sharp edges. 
        Even though many car enthusiasts do not like its shape, everybody agrees on the fact that it is one of a kind.</p></div>
        <p><img src="https://images-wixmp-ed30a86b8c4ca887773594c2.wixmp.com/f/5a796fd7-2f9b-4bdd-9e1c-4b608f663d45/dcj0ek6-7e330988-6e73-467c-bb71-d7dc0c36199d.jpg/v1/fill/w_1600,h_1067,q_75,strp/1989_lamborghini_countach_25th_anniversary_edition_by_kamaji_h_dcj0ek6-fullview.jpg?token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJ1cm46YXBwOiIsImlzcyI6InVybjphcHA6Iiwib2JqIjpbW3siaGVpZ2h0IjoiPD0xMDY3IiwicGF0aCI6IlwvZlwvNWE3OTZmZDctMmY5Yi00YmRkLTllMWMtNGI2MDhmNjYzZDQ1XC9kY2owZWs2LTdlMzMwOTg4LTZlNzMtNDY3Yy1iYjcxLWQ3ZGMwYzM2MTk5ZC5qcGciLCJ3aWR0aCI6Ijw9MTYwMCJ9XV0sImF1ZCI6WyJ1cm46c2VydmljZTppbWFnZS5vcGVyYXRpb25zIl19._jt0Ulew-szfQcSc7nqn192tujfjZ1eQ62armDXZC8A"
        width="230"></p>
        <div id="box4"><p> DeLorean DMC 12: The brand DeLorean was born to compete with European sportscar brands; but unfortunately it fell short. The DMC 12 was rather slow and it didn’t handle well. However, it became a big icon due to its appearance on Back to the Future. This goes to show how mediocre products can become successful due to trends.</p></div>
        <p><img src="https://static.motor.es/fotos-noticias/2017/04/delorean-dmc-12-1981-201735638_1.jpg" width="230"></p>
        <div id="box4"><p> Audi Quattro: Despite the fact that it looks like a box, it had great success in rally races in the 80´s. It handled well and it was also very reliable. Its name comes from the Italian word for “four”; that makes reference to the quattro’s all-wheel-drive system. 
        It was partially hand-built and there were no major changes in its design although its production lasted 11 years.</p></div>

        <h2 id="web-90"><div id="box6">Best cars from the 90´s</h2></div>
        <div id="box1"><p>Car design changed completely in the 90’s.Sharp-edged boxy cars weren´t fashionable anymore. Curves came back all the way from the 60’s, and sharp ends started to disappear. The engines became more powerful, and new material such as carbon fiber became common in spotscars, although it was already used by Ferrari in the 80´s.
        Headlamp designs also evolved and airbags were popularized in inexpensive vehicles.</p></div>
        <h3>Top Cars</h3>
        <div id="box6"><p>McLaren F1: Jay Leno, one of the most if not the most famous car fans of all time believes that the F1 is the best car ever made. Its combination of raw power, great handling and smooth appearance makes it a beauty of a car. Furthermore, it isn´t a two-seater; but a three-seater!
        The steering wheel can be found right in the middle of the cockpit, just like in an F1 car.</p></div>
        <p><img src=" https://fotografias.lasexta.com/clipping/cmsimages02/2018/02/28/B64356AE-5BE7-48DF-988D-8F48671A52D0/58.jpg" width="230"></p>
        <div id="box6"><p>Nissan Skyline GTR R-34: This particular GTR is the best-known Japanese sportscar from the 90´s.Many tuners from all around the world praise the Skyline due to its customizability.
        It made an appearance in Fast and Furious 2 as the main character´s car. Although it isn´t as refined as modern cars; a lot of car enthusiasts love it and look for one nonstop.</p></div>
        <p><img src="https://www.autonocion.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Nissan-GT-R-R34-930x524.jpg" width="230"></p>
        <div id="box6"><p>Dodge Viper:The 1995 viper was a concept car that Dodge decided to put into production. It had no roof, no traction control, side pipes and a 8.0 liter V10 under its enormous hood.
        It wasn´t very reliable, and owners say that it overheats like crazy; but it makes up for this with sheer speed.</p></div>

        <div id="box6"><p>Bugatti EB110: This model was released by Bugatti after 31 years without producing any cars at all. It had a powerful twelve cylinder engine and four turbochargers. It participated in LeMans, but even though it was competitive, it couldn´t finish the race.
        Its chassis was built by Aérospatiale, an aircraft company, and it was made in carbon fibre.</p></div>
        <p><img src="https://i.blogs.es/bc3ad2/be07b798-bugatti-eb220-ss-01/1366_2000.jpg" width="230"></p>     
        <h2 id="web-2000"><div id="box5">Best cars from our time</h2></div>
        <div id="box1"><p>In our time, climate change is a big asset; so manufacturers have came up with ways to reduce fuel use. Hybrid technology consists of using a combustion engine along with an electric motor. The power output is great and the fuel consumption isn´t as big. Electric vehicles have also developed; and their range is as big as a petrol car´s.
        Furthermore, car design has sped up; making rather new cars appear a bit old-fashioned.</p></div>
        <h3>Top Cars</h3>
        <div id="box5"><p>Ferrari Enzo: the Enzo was named after Enzo Ferrari himself, so Ferrari had to do a great job inventing this piece.It was developed in 2002 using Formula One technology.
        Luckily, the company didn´t disappoint. It features a carbon fibre body, F1-style automated shift transmission and carbon fibre-ceramic brakes, similar to the ones found in F1 cars.</p></div>
        <p><img src="https://carsguide-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/f_auto,fl_lossy,q_auto,t_cg_hero_large/v1/editorial/story/hero_image/2002-Ferrari-Enzo-coupe-red-1001x565-%281%29.jpg" width="230"></p>
        <div id="box5"><p>Bugatti Veyron: this supercar redefined the term speed. It broke the previous speed record, set by the McLaren F1. But it wasn´t just a little bit faster, as it could surpass the 400 kp/h barrier.
        That´s a 50 km/h difference! Its vintage grill, round shape and W16 engine are, to this day, trademarks of Bugatti.</p></div>
        <p><img src="https://img.motor16.com/articulos/15000/15207_p8qJsY0iRNHm4-p1.jpg" width="230"></p>
        <div id="box5"><p>Tesla Model S: the model S is a big statement for electric car development. It shows that electric vehicles can be as reliable and as beautiful as petrol cars. It is fully electric, and it can go from 0-100 km/h in just 2,4 seconds. On top of that, it has an auto-pilot feature that works very well.
        As of March 2020, the Model S Long Range Plus has a range of  630, which is higher than any other electric car.</p></div>
        <p><img src="https://static.motor.es/fotos-noticias/2020/04/precio-tesla-model-s-2020-202067012-1588267713_1.jpg" width="230"></p>
        <div id="box5"><p>Koeniggsegg Regera: the Regera is the fastest hybrid car on the market. The car is powered by a 5.0 litre V8 engine and three electric motors. These four elements produce a massive 1500 HP.
        All that power is fed to the rear wheels through a direct-drive system rather than a traditional gearbox, so there´s no break in the car´s acceleration.<p></div>
